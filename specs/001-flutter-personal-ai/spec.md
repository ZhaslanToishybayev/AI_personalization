# Feature Specification: Personal AI Assistant Mobile App

**Feature Branch**: `[001-flutter-personal-ai]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Flutter/Dart mobile app for personal AI assistant"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A busy professional opens the personal AI assistant mobile app to get proactive help with daily planning. They review their agenda, ask the assistant to summarize overnight messages, receive tailored suggestions for tasks, and confirm a proposed schedule for the day.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user launching the app for the first time, **When** they complete onboarding by granting required permissions and answering preference questions, **Then** the assistant creates a personalized profile and greets them with a suggested daily plan.
2. **Given** an authenticated user with synced calendar and messaging data, **When** they request "summarize my important updates" via voice or text, **Then** the assistant returns a prioritized summary with actionable follow-ups that can be accepted or dismissed individually.
3. **Given** a user reviewing their day plan, **When** the assistant detects an upcoming conflict or overruns based on live context, **Then** the app alerts the user and offers alternative arrangements or automation options (e.g., reschedule, delegate, set reminder) for confirmation.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the device is offline or the AI service cannot be reached? 
- How does the system handle users who skip permission prompts, resulting in limited context data? 
- What is the expected behavior when the AI generates suggestions that conflict with user-defined constraints or compliance rules?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST onboard new users with consent-driven collection of personal preferences, working hours, and notification settings.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST ingest and analyze personal context signals (calendar, tasks, messages) to surface relevant insights per session.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to communicate with the assistant via natural language text and voice within the mobile app interface.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide proactive daily plans, reminders, and smart suggestions that users can accept, snooze, or decline.
- **FR-005**: The assistant MUST learn from user feedback (accept/decline actions) to refine future recommendations.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST enforce GDPR/CCPA + SOC 2 Type II compliance: explicit consent per data source, 30-day rolling retention for cached data, self-service export/delete flows, and incident response with 72-hour breach notification.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST receive transparent explanations for suggested actions, including originating context signals, confidence score (0.0–1.0), and next-step rationale rendered as structured cards with optional deep links.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST notify users about critical changes via in-app banners and push notifications within 5 minutes of detection, respecting configurable quiet hours while allowing overrides for emergencies.
- **FR-009**: The assistant MUST respect user-defined boundaries configured during onboarding and in settings (quiet hours, topics to avoid, escalation paths) and enforce them before generating or sending any proactive suggestions.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST support localized UI and assistant responses for English (US), Spanish (LatAm), and German (DE) at launch, with runtime locale switching and fallback strings.
- **FR-011**: The mobile experience MUST adhere to a Liquid Glass visual identity featuring layered translucent surfaces, soft gradients, and dynamic lighting cues while preserving accessibility contrast ratios (WCAG AA) and motion-reduction fallbacks.

### Visual and interaction style
- Adopt a Liquid Glass design language across all screens: frosted glass panels, depth-creating shadows, subtle animated light refractions, and blur-backed surfaces that respond to context.
- Surface critical information on elevated translucent cards; background layers should employ gradient washes aligned with time-of-day or assistant mood states.
- Ensure adaptive theming for light/dark modes maintains readability; when translucency conflicts with contrast requirements, provide solid-color fallback states.
- Codify reusable tokens (color, blur radius, corner radius, elevation) in the Flutter theme to keep tests and golden snapshots deterministic.
- Document interactive affordances (buttons, chips, voice controls) to feel tactile—micro-animations must respect reduced motion settings.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Profile**: Captures identity, preferences, consent status, locale, working hours, notification rules, and personalization boundaries.
- **Context Signal**: Represents external data ingested (calendar events, tasks, emails/messages) with metadata about source, priority, freshness, and permissions.
- **Assistive Suggestion**: Describes proactive recommendations, including trigger rationale, confidence score, recommended action(s), and user feedback outcome.
- **Interaction Session**: Groups a conversation or voice exchange with the assistant, storing user intent, assistant responses, and actions taken for learning purposes. Retains transcripts for 30 days before anonymized aggregation.
